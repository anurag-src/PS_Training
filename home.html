            On the first day, we started with an orientation from Venkatesh Sir about our upcoming schedule for the training period and internship. We were then introduced to Lakshman Sir who then started teaching us about HTML and CSS. We learnt about what a mockup language was, and the basics of HTML and CSS. We were given the task of creating a simple profile page with some basic elements like headers and images.

        <div class = "container container1">
          <div class = "row bg-warning">
            <div class = "col-m" style = "text-align: center;"><b>Day 2 :</b> Bootstrap</div>
          </div>
          
            <p style = "text-align: left;">
              Now that we had a clear idea on how the syntax worked and the basic elements, we were introduced to Bootstrap, a sort of library that allowed us to work with more complicated visual and navigational structures easier like tables, buttons and more. We learnt about the sophisticated grid system and were shown some examples of how a reasponsive page was supposed to work. We were supposed to construct a simple statistics page with a table along with login and register pages to acclimitize ourselves to working with more complicated structures.

          <div class = "container container1">
            <div class = "row bg-warning">
              <div class = "col-m" style = "text-align: center;"><b>Day 3 :</b> Javascript</div>
            </div>
            
              <p style = "text-align: left;">
                On the third day, we started to move towards a less visually oriented approach to web developement. Fubctionality came into play as we learnt the basics of javascript and how we could connect that to provide computational and regular functionality to a primarily visual iterface. We learnt different ways to code actions to events like clicks, and how to link that code to the HTML. This day's task was to implement certain functions like mathematical calculators that we had to write into a website, which required both visual and functional coding skills.
